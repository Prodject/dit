{"name":"Dit","tagline":"dotfile management that thinks it's git","body":"# Dit\r\n\r\n![Dit version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/dit.svg)\r\n\r\nDit is a dotfile manager that hooks into git.\r\n\r\nIt uses git hooks to automatically run whenever you `git commit` or `git merge`. You just keep working on that dotfiles directory as normal and dit handles the rest.\r\n\r\nWindows isn't currently supported due to a conspicious lack of symlinking on windows. Suggestions as to circumvent this restriction are welcome.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nAssuming ruby and rubygems are already installed (if not, refer to your various package managers)\r\n\r\n`gem install dit`  \r\n`dit init`\r\n\r\nThen, use your git repository as normal. Any new files will automatically be symlinked to your home directory.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nPlease do!\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n[![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-ruby.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)\r\n[![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-love.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)\r\n[![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/uses-badges.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
